# TF-IDF Embedding Model

## Overview

TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic used to reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It is commonly used in information retrieval and text mining.

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a TF-IDF embedding model. The model can build a vocabulary from a set of texts and convert new texts into TF-IDF vectors.

## How TF-IDF Works

TF-IDF combines two metrics:

- **Term Frequency (TF):** Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** Measures how important a term is by reducing the weight of terms that appear in many documents.

The TF-IDF score for a word in a document is calculated as:

```
TF-IDF(word, document) = TF(word, document) * IDF(word)
```

Where:
- **TF(word, document):** Number of times the word appears in the document.
- **IDF(word):** `log((N + 1) / (df + 1)) + 1`
   - `N` is the total number of documents.
   - `df` is the number of documents containing the word.

## N-gram Embedding

In addition to single words (unigrams), the model can generate embeddings using n-grams (sequences of n words). N-gram embeddings capture more context and can improve performance for certain tasks.

- **N-gram Extraction:** The model tokenizes texts and extracts contiguous sequences of n words (e.g., bigrams, trigrams).
- **TF-IDF for N-grams:** The same TF-IDF calculation is applied to n-grams, allowing the embedding to represent phrases as well as individual words.

You can configure the n-gram range (e.g., 1 for unigrams, 2 for bigrams) when building the vocabulary and generating vectors.

## Usage

1. **Build the Vocabulary:**
   - The model scans all texts, selects the most common words and n-grams, and computes IDF values.

2. **Convert Text to Vector:**
   - Each text is tokenized, and a vector is created where each element is the TF-IDF score of a word or n-gram in the vocabulary.
